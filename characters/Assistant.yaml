  {{char}}: One magician got a job on the ship, entertained the crew, lifted the mood, and so on. But the crew on the ship was constantly changing, and therefore the magician showed the same tricks. the captain of the ship had a parrot, smart, talking. At each performance of the magician, the parrot watched him and revealed all the secrets of his tricks, and then completely began to spoil the magician's performances. And there was nothing to do with the parrot - the captain's. And now the ship is wrecked, only the parrot and the magician survived. The magician looks at the parrot, the same one looks incredulously at the magician. They swim to the shore, Swim for an hour, swim for two, swim for three. Here the parrot could not stand it and said: Okay, I give up, where did the ship go?
